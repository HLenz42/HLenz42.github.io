## Research Experiance
### Searching For Globular Clusters in NGC 7332 and NGC 7339 using CFHT
<!--[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048) -->

The spatial distribution of globular clusters (GCs) in galactic halos offers critical insights into the formation and evolution of their host galaxies. We combine new CFHT/WIRCam Ks-band imaging with archival CFHT/MegaCam optical data to identify GCs around the giant lenticular galaxy NGC 7332 and its spiral companion NGC 7339 using a uiKs colour-colour diagram. Given their close proximity to each other (35.2kpc assuming a shared distance of 20.5Mpc), we investigate the potential gravitational interaction by analyzing the spatial and colour distributions of their GC systems. The Ks-band data was obtained with CFHT/WIRCam as part of a proposal written for an inaugural undergraduate international learning experience provided by the University of Calgary in Spring 2024, led by Dr. Langill and Dr. Taylor. As part of this program, twelve students participated in writing proposals for CFHT and Gemini North, visited each observatory’s base facilities, and toured the telescopes at the summit of Maunakea. The uiKs diagram is a powerful tool to separate GCs from background galaxies and foreground stars by their magnitude variations across three filters. Early results have identified 90 GC candidates orbiting NGC 7332 and NGC 7339, providing key insights into their potential interaction and evolutionary histories.

### Variable Star Analysis Detection Pipeline

This was one of the projects I worked on as a Intern at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory.

### SCIE 507: Hawai'i Maunakea Observatories 2024

This was a inagral global learning class at the University of Calgary set up by two amazing proffesors Dr. Langill and Dr. Taylor. During this class we simulated what it is like to be a proffesional astrophysisit, we came up with a research idea, wrote proposals to both the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and Gemini North Telescope, and recived data back. Before we went on the trip we desided a good project for CFHT would be to observe NGC 7332 and NGC 7339 in the Ks band with WIRcam such that we could identify globular clusters, for Gemini we proposed to look at a globular cluster, M5, that has been reported to be rotating at an abnormaly fast rate, utilizing the GENRES instrument we wanted to confirm theese results. After submiting these proposals and getting time on both telescopes, 12 students and 2 proffessors went to the big island of Hawai'i. While at Hawai'i we toured the base facilities of both CFHT and Gemini and talked to the people working there who told us about the operation of the telecopes and the diffrent instruments used. We were lucky to be at both base facilites at night to see the telescopes in action and the variouse programs and procedurse used to control them. We were then even more luck to visit the telescopes at the sumit where we recived tours and talked to the Enginers currently working there, which was a truly incredible experiance. Unfortently Gemini was not able to collect data for us. When recived the data back from CFHT we started reducing it as a group, however we ran out of time in the semester. This is when I asked my supervisors to continue this work as my undergraduate thesis project, using new WIRcam Ks band CFHT data along with cataloge CFHT MegaCam data. 

### Exoplanet Observations 
<!--[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)-->

This was one of the projects I worked on as a Intern at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory. I was assisting a fellow student in collecting data for ∼40 Exoplanets with the Clark-Milone Telescope, A.R. Cross Telescope and the Plaskett Telescope.

### WASP-12b Exoplanet Analysis
<!--[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)-->

This was my final project in ASPH 307, Observational Astrophysis, at the university of Calgary. In this lab using data from the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory I was able to reduce the transit data and fine a result consitant with published values for the size, orbital speed, and mass of WASP-12b.

### Stellar Evolution Laboratory 
<!--[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)-->

This was my final project in ASPH 403, Stellar Structure and Evolution, at the University of Calgary. In this lab I used the stellar evolution code MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) to study the evolution of a 1.1 M⊙ star if it started with a Z=0.02 solar metalisity or started with a Z=0.0001 metalisity.



### Observing Laboratory 
<!--[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)-->

This was my final project in ASPH 305, Introduction to Astrophysics, at the University of Calgary. In this lab I used an 8 inch telescope and CCD camera to take data of Jupiter and stack into a final image and measure the diameter of Jupiter and Saturn.
