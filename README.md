## Research Experiance {#research-experience}
### Undergraduate Thesis Project - Searching For Globular Clusters in NGC 7332 and NGC 7339 using CFHT {#globular-clusters-ngc}

**Supervisors:** Dr. Matthew Taylor and Dr. Phil Langill

**Abstract:**
The spatial distribution of globular clusters (GCs) in galactic halos offers critical insights into the formation and evolution of their host galaxies. We combine new CFHT/WIRCam Ks-band imaging with archival CFHT/MegaCam optical data to identify GCs around the giant lenticular galaxy NGC 7332 and its spiral companion NGC 7339 using a uiKs colour-colour diagram. Given their close proximity to each other (35.2kpc assuming a shared distance of 20.5Mpc), we investigate the potential gravitational interaction by analyzing the spatial and colour distributions of their GC systems. The Ks-band data was obtained with CFHT/WIRCam as part of a proposal written for an inaugural undergraduate international learning experience provided by the University of Calgary in Spring 2024, led by Dr. Langill and Dr. Taylor. As part of this program, twelve students participated in writing proposals for CFHT and Gemini North, visited each observatory’s base facilities, and toured the telescopes at the summit of Maunakea. The uiKs diagram is a powerful tool to separate GCs from background galaxies and foreground stars by their magnitude variations across three filters. Early results have identified 90 GC candidates orbiting NGC 7332 and NGC 7339, providing key insights into their potential interaction and evolutionary histories.

Veiw my [Final Physics 599 Report](/assets/img/Phys599_FinalReport_HLenz(2).pdf) note that after I finished this class in the fall 2024 semester I continued work on the project during my internsip and eventualy impoved my analysis of the data to find more concreet results as presented in <a href="/assets/img/HLenz-CASCAPoster.pdf" type="application/pdf" target="_blank">my poster</a> I presented at CASCA 2025 and the CFHT users meeting 2025.

*Image of NGC 7332 (right) and NGC 7339 (left) with 139 newly identified globular clusters.*

**This project had three goals:**
1. Identify globular clusters (GCs) based on their magnitude in u, i, and 𝐾𝑠 filters using a 𝑢𝑖𝐾𝑠 colour-colour diagram. With new 𝐾_𝑠-band data this method of GC detection is now possible
2. Determine host galaxy interactions the spatial distribution of GCs can indicate weather these two galaxies are in the early stages of galactic interaction.
3. Study galactic history from the bimodal blue-red colour distribution of GCs.

These galaxies were chosen because they are edge on, close proximity (35.2kpc) to each other, and had catalogue data for the in u, and i filters observed by MegaCam/CFHT but no 𝐾𝑠 data. A proposal was written to CFHT for WIRCam to observe these galaxies in the 𝐾𝑠-band as part of an inaugural undergraduate international learning experience lead by Dr. Langill and Dr. Taylor in May 2024

*The 𝑢𝑖𝐾𝑠 colour-colour diagram characterizing objects using magnitude measurements of sources around NGC 7332 and NGC 7339 in near ultraviolet (u), optical (i), and near infaread (Ks). Using the normalized colours (𝑢−𝑖)_0  and (𝑖−𝐾𝑠)_0  GCs can be separated a method first used in 2014 by Dr. Muñoz* 

The globular clusters were selected from the central region of the ui𝐾𝑠 as seen in the figure aboce. Candidates were then filtered using photometric measurements made by Source Extractor such as, magnitude, flux radius, and ellipticity. Image cutouts of the globular clusters were made to confirm GC-like appearance and proximity to its host galaxy (within 5 effective radii) in order for them to be considered gravitationaly bound.  

![distribution study of globular clusters](/assets/img/distributions_and_ptest.png)
*The observed distribution of globular clusters versus a randome distribution of globular clusters around NGC 7332 and NGC 7339 compaired using the kolmogorov smirnov test to show a p value of 1.7 × 10^-4.*

To test whether the observed globular cluster distribution is the results from overlap of two globular cluster systems or gravitational interaction random globular cluster distributions were generated based on observed distances of globular clusters. The figure above shows that the random generated distribution produced a relatively even globular cluster density, while the observed data shows a central concentration. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirms a statistically significant (p=1.7 × 10^-4) difference between the distributions, supporting the case for non-random structure and possible interaction.

![uiKs diagram used to idetifiy globular clusters](/assets/img/histogram.png)

*u-Ks histogram reveals a blue-red globular cluster bimodality with more red globular clusters suggesting these galaxies formed though mergers with fewer larger galaxies rather than many smaller galaxies. Note that after study of distribution of red and blue globular clusters no meniful pattern was found from either globular cluster type mainly being around either galaxie, it was an even distribution.*

**Conclusions for my three goals:**
1. Using a 𝑢𝑖𝐾𝑠  colour–colour diagram, I have identified 139 GC candidates surrounding NGC 7332 and NGC 7339. This method combines near-UV (𝑢), optical (𝑖), and near-infrared (𝐾𝑠) photometry to effectively isolate globular clusters in colour space. Although the candidates match expected photometric and structural properties of globular clusters, spectroscopic confirmation is needed to verify their identities and association with their host galaxies.
2. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test comparing the cumulative radial distributions of observed and randomly generated globular cluster positions. The resulting p-value (p=1.7×10^(−4)) indicates a statistically significant difference, this rejects the null hypothesis that the observed distribution is random. This supports the presence of a non-random spatial structure, which is consistent with gravitational interaction between NGC 7332 and NGC 7339.
3. The u-Ks colour histogram of the identified globular clusters shows a larger population of red globular clusters indicating that these two galaxies were formed by though mergers with fewer larger galaxies rather than many smaller galaxies.


### Variable Star Analysis Pipeline {#variable-star-pipeline}

As a major project during my internship at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (RAO), I developed a Python-based pipeline for detecting variable stars from raw astronomical images. The code automates the entire process: starting with input raw images, darks, biases, and flats, it performs bias, dark, and flat corrections. It then uploads the corrected images to astrometry.net to obtain World Coordinate System (WCS) information, followed by running Source Extractor for photometry to generate catalogs. A tracking script automatically follows stars across the image set, producing check plots for verification. The pipeline queries SIMBAD for star classifications, flagging known variables, and performs differential photometry by selecting a user-specified number of nearby non-variable comparison stars. It iteratively detects new variables from the initial photometry run, flags them, and reruns differential photometry to refine results, ensuring comparison stars are stable. Finally, it generates detailed plots and analysis logs highlighting potential new variable stars in the field. I adapted this pipeline to handle data from all RAO telescopes, including the CMT, ARCT, and KGMT.

This project significantly enhanced my programming skills in Python, image processing, and astronomical data analysis. At RAO, I applied it to real telescope data, improving efficiency in variable star detection for outreach and research. It also integrated techniques from my globular cluster research with the Canada France Hawaii Telescope, such as photometry using Source Extractor and tracking, preparing me for graduate-level work in stellar variability and time-series analysis with large data sets in python.

The videos embeded below show a timelaps of two stars as analised by my script. The first video show the exoplanet curve for WASP-12b an exoplanet transit observed many times at the RAO with the KGMT, the second video shows the timelaps for one of the comparison stars used in the differential phtometry of WASP-12b.

### SCIE 507: Hawai'i Maunakea Observatories 2024 {#maunakea-2024}

This was a inagral global learning class at the University of Calgary set up by two amazing proffesors Dr. Langill and Dr. Taylor. During this class we simulated what it is like to be a proffesional astrophysisit, we came up with a research idea, wrote proposals to both the Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) and Gemini North Telescope, and recived data back. Before we went on the trip we desided a good project for CFHT would be to observe NGC 7332 and NGC 7339 in the Ks band with WIRcam such that we could identify globular clusters, for Gemini we proposed to look at a globular cluster, M5, that has been reported to be rotating at an abnormaly fast rate, utilizing the GENRES instrument we wanted to confirm theese results. After submiting these proposals and getting time on both telescopes, 12 students and 2 proffessors went to the big island of Hawai'i. While at Hawai'i we toured the base facilities of both CFHT and Gemini and talked to the people working there who told us about the operation of the telecopes and the diffrent instruments used. We were lucky to be at both base facilites at night to see the telescopes in action and the variouse programs and procedurse used to control them. We were then even more luck to visit the telescopes at the sumit where we recived tours and talked to the Enginers currently working there, which was a truly incredible experiance. Unfortently Gemini was not able to collect data for us. When recived the data back from CFHT we started reducing it as a group, however we ran out of time in the semester. This is when I asked my supervisors to continue this work as my undergraduate thesis project, using new WIRcam Ks band CFHT data along with cataloge CFHT MegaCam data.

### Exoplanet Observations {#exoplanet-observations} 

During my internship at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (RAO), I collaborated with another intern to observe over 50 exoplanet transits, often coordinating multiple telescopes, including the CMT, ARCT, KGMT, and Plaskett to simultaneously target the same transit event in diffrent filters. This multi-telescope approach allowed us to capture high-quality light curves by pointing all instruments at a single exoplanet target, mitigating issues such as weather or instrumental variability while maximizing signal-to-noise ratios. I personally collected exoplanet data using the CMT, ARCT, and KGMT telescopes, focusing on transit photometry to measure planetary parameters such as radius, orbital period, and impact parameter. 

These observations built on my prior coursework in Astrophysics 307, where I analyzed WASP-12b transits, refining my skills in telescope coordination, real-time data acquisition, and multi-instrument synchronization. At RAO, this experience directly informed my work on outreach programs and contributed to the adaptation of my variable star analysis detection pipeline, incorporating transit detection algorithms for identifying periodic variability in exoplanet host stars and improving automated photometry for time-series datasets.

### Stellar Evolution Laboratory {#stellar-evolution-lab}

As part of my Astrophysics 403 term project at the University of Calgary, I collaborated with Andrea Luhar to model the evolution of a 1.1 solar mass star using MESA (Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics) software, tracing its lifecycle from pre-main sequence to white dwarf stages. We generated HR diagrams and analyzed luminosity changes, finding that the proton-proton (PP) chain dominated hydrogen burning, maintaining a stable ~1 L⊙ after 10^7 years, while the triple-alpha process triggered a helium flash peaking at ~10^7 L⊙ around 8.7 billion years for higher metallicity (Z=0.02). We also plotted stellar radius, core temperature, and elemental abundances (H, He, C), revealing sharp transitions in core composition and density during hydrogen and helium burning phases, with a notable “switchback” maneuver in the horizontal branch.

Re-simulating with low metallicity (Z=0.0001), we discovered a halved main sequence lifetime (4.3 billion years for helium flash) and a smoother HR diagram path without the switchback, with the second luminosity peak during helium burning 100 times brighter (10^7 L⊙) than the solar metallicity model. The low metallicity star exhibited more gradual density and temperature transitions between shells, with faster core hydrogen depletion and extended white dwarf cooling. These results deepened my expertise in stellar evolution modeling and data analysis, complementing my research with the Canada France Hawaii Telescope and internship at Rothney Astrophysical Observatory.

### WASP-12b Exoplanet Analysis {#wasp-12b-analysis}

This was my final project in ASPH 307, Observational Astrophysis, at the university of Calgary. In this lab using data from the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory I was able to reduce the transit data and fine a result consitant with published values for the size, orbital speed, and mass of WASP-12b.


As part of my Astrophysics 307, Observational Astrophysis, group project at the University of Calgary, I worked in a group to study the exoplanet transit of WASP-12b across its host star WASP-12a. Using software tools like Mira and Tycho, we pre-processed astronomical images by subtracting darks and biases, dividing by flats, and performing photometry to measure instrumental magnitudes. We analyzed atmospheric extinction, determining coefficients around 0.6 for our target and reference stars, and generated light curves with up to 20 comparison stars to reveal a clear transit dip. From this, we calculated a magnitude difference of ~0.012 during transit, flux ratios indicating a ~1% brightness drop, and estimated the planet's radius at approximately 12 Earth radii which is consistant with published values. 

This project honed my skills in image processing, photometry, and light curve analysis, which I later applied during my internship at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (RAO), where I operated telescopes and coordinated outreach. It also laid the foundation for developing my variable star analysis detection pipeline, enhancing my proficiency in handling variable astronomical data and preparing me for advanced research in stellar and exoplanet studies.

### Spectra Stidies with the RAO Echelle Spectrograph {#echelle-spectrograph}

As part of my Astrophysics 307, Observational Astrophysis, group project at the University of Calgary, I worked in a group to analyze stellar spectra obtained from the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory's (RAO) Echelle Spectrograph using Visual Spec software. We measured Earth's orbital speed by examining Doppler shifts in the 34th and 35th orders of spectra from β Gem (sunset, K0 III) and α Ser (sunrise, K2 III), calculating an average velocity of approximately 23 km/s, which deviated slightly from the theoretical 29.78 km/s due to potential instrumental errors. The second part of the project involved qualitative analysis of spectral profiles for stars of decreasing temperatures (A1.5 IV at 9185 K, F5 IV at 6700 K, G9.5 III at 5480 K, M0.5 III at 3630 K), identifying elements like Ti, Zr, Cr, and Fe, and noting trends such as increasing noise, wider absorption lines, and more lines in cooler stars due to atmospheric density differences. Part C explored the spectrograph's mechanics, including trends in plate factors decreasing with higher orders for better resolution (up to ~10,000), enabling radial velocity measurements down to ~30 km/s, with a slit angular size of ~2.5" and effective focal length of ~4.125 m.

This project enhanced my expertise in spectral rectification, Gaussian fitting, and Doppler analysis, skills I directly applied during my internship at the RAO, where I operated telescopes and processed spectroscopic data for outreach and research. It also built foundational knowledge in handling wavelength shifts and absorption features, which informed the development of my variable star analysis detection pipeline by improving techniques for identifying variability in stellar spectra and light curves.

### Jupiter Size Measurement Laboratory {#observing-lab}

As part of my Astrophysics 305 lab at the University of Calgary, I collaborated with fellow students to measure the physical size of Jupiter and its atmospheric bands using ground-based observations. On October 3, 2022, we used a Celestron 8-inch telescope with a Neximage 5 CCD camera on the University of Calgary campus, capturing AVI videos under clear skies. After processing images in Registax 6.1 (stacking 55% of frames, applying wavelet transforms, and RGB balancing), we analyzed them in SAOImage to determine pixel sizes, calculating Jupiter's angular diameter (43.9") and physical diameter (1.26 × 10^8 m, close to the actual 1.43 × 10^8 m). We also measured the upper band's size (9.22 × 10^6 m), lower band's size (9.88 × 10^6 m), and distance between bands (3.18 × 10^7 m), with errors (1.09 × 10^6 m) derived from Gaussian FWHM analysis, noting discrepancies possibly due to atmospheric seeing or instrumental factors. 

This lab sharpened my skills in telescope operation, image processing with Registax and SAOImage, and trigonometric calculations for angular measurements, which I directly applied during my internship at the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (RAO), where I handled similar CCD imaging and data reduction for planetary and stellar observations. It also provided foundational experience in analyzing variable features like planetary bands, influencing the development of my variable star analysis detection pipeline by improving techniques for frame stacking, noise reduction, and precise photometric measurements in dynamic astronomical datasets.

## Successful Observing Proposals {#observing-proposals}
- Co-I, Gemini North Observatory, 2.83 hours (2024)
  - **Project:** "Seeing Stars! Measuring the dizzying spin of the Galactic globular cluster M5"
  - **Goal:** To use the Gemini Near-InfraRead Spectrograph (GNIRS) to measure the rotational velocity of the globular cluster M5. This globular cluster was important to observe as a previouse paper reported it to have an abnoraly high spin rate, therfore by observing M5 with GNIRS we could confirm this measurment.
- Co-I, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, 3 hours (2024)
  - **Project:** “Searching for Globular Clusters in NGC 7332 & NGC 7339”
  - **Goal:** To observe the galaxies NGC 7332 and NGC 7339 using WIRcam. With this new Ks band data and catalogue u and i band data from the Megacam instrument we could use the uiKs colour coluor plot method to identify globular clusters around NGC 7332 and NGC 7339. This was important because these galaxise are 35.2kpc apart from eachother therefore should be in the early stages of galactic interaction, therfore based on the distribution of the globular cluster we can determine if this is so.
