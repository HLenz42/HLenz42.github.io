description: Hello! I am Heather Lenz, a fourth-year B.Sc. student in Astrophysics and Physics at the University of Calgary (expected graduation: May 2026). At the Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (RAO), I’ve operated telescopes (CMT, ARCT, KGMT) to observe exoplanet transits and developed a Python-based pipeline for variable star detection. My research includes studying globular clusters with CFHT data and modeling stellar evolution with MESA. Passionate about astronomical instrumentation, I aim to pursue a master’s degree to advance telescope design and data analysis. I also lead RAO outreach, coordinating 100+ volunteers and delivering lectures for diverse audiences.
