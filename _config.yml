description: Hello! My name is Heather Lenz, and I am a fourth-year B.Sc. student in Astrophysics and Physics at the University of Calgary, set to graduate in May 2026. With over a year as an intern at the **Rothney Astrophysical Observatory (RAO)**, I have developed expertise in operating telescopes (CMT, ARCT, KGMT) to observe exoplanet transits, globular clusters, and other celestial phenomena, while also creating Python-based pipelines for automated photometry and variable star detection. My research includes analyzing **Canada France Hawaii Telescope (CFHT)** data to identify globular clusters in NGC 7332 and NGC 7339, modeling stellar evolution with **MESA**, and measuring Jupiter’s size through ground-based observations. Passionate about advancing astronomical instrumentation, I am eager to pursue a master’s degree to design and optimize cutting-edge telescope systems and data analysis tools. I have also led public outreach at RAO, delivering lectures to diverse audiences and coordinating 100+ volunteers for events like Space Nights and Milky Way Nights, fostering a passion for astronomy in the community.
